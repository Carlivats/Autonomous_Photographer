## 3D Printed Parts

The .pwmx files in this directory were used to fabricate prototype components for this project.
If you rather see the STL files you might find them [here](https://github.com/Carlivats/Autonomous_Photographer/tree/main/src/hardware/stl)

They were printed on the hardware listed below and may require adjustment to work correctly on other printers or setups.

### Printing Environment
- **Printer:** Anycubic Photon Mono X (resin printer)  
- **Resin:** Anycubic Standard Resin V2 (Gray)

### Notes & Disclaimer
- Tolerances, fit, and print quality may vary depending on printer model, resin type, and slicer settings.  
- As this project is still under active development, the designs are **subject to change** and may contain issues.
- These files are provided primarily for reference and prototyping purposes.

Fell free to to modify, re-slice, or redesign parts as needed to suit their own hardware and requirements!
